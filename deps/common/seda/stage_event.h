//! An event in a staged event-driven architecture
/**
 * Abstract base class for all events.  Each event can reference
 * a stack of completion callbacks. A callback is added to an event using
 * the pushCallback() method.  The first completion callback on the stack
 * is invoked by calling the done() method of StageEvent.  The Stage code
 * handling an event (either in handleEvent() or callbackEvent()) has
 * certain responsibilities regarding how the event and its associated
 * callbacks are processed. When a stage finishes processing an
 * event it has the following options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pass the event along to another stage for processing.  In this
 * case the responsibility to eventually call done() passes to the next
 * stage.
 * <li>Pass the event along to another stage for processing but add a
 * callback to the event for the current stage.  In this case, the stage
 * must create a callback object and use the pushCallback() interface
 * to add the callback to the top of the event's callback stack. Again,
 * the responsibility for calling done() passes to the next stage.
 * <li>Dispose of the event.  This is achieved by calling done().  After
 * calling done() the stage must not access the event again.  Note that
 * done() will result in callbacks attached to the event being executed
 * asynchronously by the threadpool of the stage which set the callback.
 * Calling doneImmediate() has the same effect as done(), except that the
 * callbacks are executed on the current stack.
 * </ul>

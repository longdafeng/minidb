/**
 * The Threadpool class consists of a pool of worker threads and a
 * scheduling queue of active seda Stages that have events that need
 * processing.  Each thread in the thread pool constantly examines the
 * head of the scheduling queue for a scheduled stage.  It then removes
 * the scheduled stage from the queue, and selects an event from the
 * Stage's event queue for processing. The thread then processes the event
 * using the Stage's handleEvent() member function before starting the
 * process over.  If the thread finds the scheduling queue empty, it sleeps
 * on a condition waiting for Stages to schedule themselves.
 * <p>
 * The number of threads in the pool can be controlled by clients. On
 * creation, the caller provides a parameter indicating the initial number
 * of worker threads, but this number can be adjusted at any time by using
 * the addThreads(), numThreads(), and killThreads() interfaces.
